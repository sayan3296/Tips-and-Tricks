## How to reuse the existing ssh-connection to speedup the overall ssh-connectivity-speed at server side

cat << EOF > ~/.ssh/config 
Host *
	ControlMaster auto
	ControlPath  ~/.ssh/sockets/%r@%h-%p
	ControlPersist 600
EOF

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config

mkdir ~/.ssh/sockets

systemctl restart sshd


## Ignore DNS at any client host will result in faster connectivity

# cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep DNS
#UseDNS yes

## Uncomment above line and set it to no followed by a restart of sshd service at client host end
